# overdamped_magnetic

Program to simulate an Overdamped Brownian
particle in a magnetic field, with the 
"wrong" equations. The flux can be calculated
at different time w.r.t the volecity that is used:
J(R,t) = < (dr/dt) delta( r(t) - a dr - R) >.
So, a=0 means dr at left time and position at right time.
And a=1. means dr and position at the same time.


The flux is calculated every integration time step
